Build instructions

1) Install Qt development tools
    - In Fedora you'll minimally want qt5-qtbase-devel and qt5-qtwebkit-devel
    - In other distributions you'll want the equivalents
    - In Windows you'll need the MinGW builds or to build yourself from source as the MSVC builds apparently do not have SSL enabled
    - In Mac OS X you're fine with the default set of packages from the installer
2) Optionally install Qt Creator
2a) Open heriot.pro in Qt Creator
2b) Select Run
3) Optionally do not install Qt Creator
3a) Execute $ qmake
3b) Execute $ make
3c) Execute the resulting built system
